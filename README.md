# Data-acquisition-through-Api
This project involved collecting data from a website and processing it to get a clearer picture of it. 
Data Acquisition is composed of two words: Data and Acquisition, where data is the raw facts and figures, which could be structured and unstructured and acquisition means acquiring data for the given task at hand.
Preparing (cleaning and arranging) raw data in order to make it appropriate for creating and training models is known as data pre-processing.
I have standardized the raw data to make it appropriate for models under Data Pre-processing, and I have removed the unnecessary columns.
In addition, I have used data manipulation to find the 5 most expensive properties. Additionally, I used mongo db to turn my data into a database. 
To do this, I first read the data into a csv file, connected to the database, then added the database's data name and collection name. 
To sum up, I was able to successfully gather the data from the website, process it, and connect it to the database.
